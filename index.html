      <h2>WHAT IS PARALLAX SCROLLING EFFECT</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Parallax scrolling is a web design technique in which the website
        background moves at a slower pace than the foreground. This results in a
        3D effect as visitors scroll down the site, adding a sense of depth and
        creating a more immersive browsing experience.Parallax is based on
        optical illusion. Since the human eye perceives objects that are close
        to us as larger than things farther away, we perceive distant objects as
        if they were moving more slowly.Parallax is based on optical illusion.

        for 2D scenes by moving background image layers slower than the
        foreground layers. The earliest use of this technique was actually an
        innovative approach to traditional animation methods created using what
        was known as a multiplane camera by Disney and first appeared during the
        1930s..Parallax is based on optical illusion. Since the human eye

        (four years to be precise) and the release of HTML5 and CSS 3 before web
        designers warmed up to the idea of using parallax scrolling in their
        work. Those that were in favor of this effect attributed the rationale
        behind their choice to an improvement in user experience and engagement
        with the websites that adopted it.Various versions of the multiplane
        camera or the likes of one were used in the past, the earliest being
        German film director and the foremost pioneer of silhouette animation,
        Charlotte "Lotte" Reiniger’s creation that was used to make her seminal
        film The Adventures of Prince Achmed in 1926. In fact, Reiniger is
        credited to have devised the first form of a multiplane camera.With
        advancements in CSS and HTML, parallax effects later evolved into the
        world of web design as we know it today.With advancements in CSS and
